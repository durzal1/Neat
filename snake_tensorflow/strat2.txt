# 0 = none | 1 = up | 2 = right | 3= down | 4 = left

try chanign elitism

snake is now in a long loop where it checks about
half othe spaces. Make it so when apple is eating moves
are reset and after a bit do a loop to make the snake
go to every move. 
Or try to perfect inputs so it goes to the food on its 
own.
8th gen didnt die




look 4 directions and give 3 outputs
0 - obstacle
1 - no obstacle
2 - food

14 grow max - gen 19
20 grow - gen 34

5th input direction to food -try 4 directions but still cover everything. 
(anything above, anything below, directly right, directly left)
maybe add distance as well 

try getting rid the same direc thing. Then try making it random(do when snake goes toward apple)
 gen 36 got 100 fitness



changed dir to -1(left), 0(above or below directly), 1(right)
got rid of 2 for each direction
for same direc it dies if does it.

make it so that each snake has its own apple
2000 pop per gen
change it instead of time each snake starts with 200 and gain 100 when get apple

fix saving and loading pickle - when it works make highest fitness show
