Have the snake look in 8 direction 
to see the distance between it and the food(if there)(Done)
distance between it and the wall (done)
distance between it and a body piece(If there)(done)



# 0 = none | 1 = up | 2 = right | 3= down | 4 = left
output = nets[x].activate((distance_itself, distance_wall_up, direction_food, distance_food, apple.x, apple.y, snake.x, snake.y ))

if str(moves[a][i]) + str(moves[a][i-1]) ==  str(moves[a][i + 1]) + str(moves[a][i+2])
